I have changed my mind. I would like to build a website that shows each client's job on each day with its graphic so that clients can receive text and graphic overview of their job on each day. The page should be responsive, accessible, attractive and use cards. Please give me the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for this project.

For a website that displays each client's job on each day with both text and graphic overviews, we'll create a layout that dynamically loads this information. The structure will be similar to the previous example but tailored to client-specific job overviews. This example will include HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamically loading content.
